Lab 4 for CSC 184 Mobile app programming based off the flutter shrine web app

This kitkat app is based on the flutter shrine web app template in Dart programming language. The lab required us to change the items from clothes to whatever we would like, and I chose kitkats. Please see demo photo for a sample of how this would look.
